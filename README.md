# Simple P2P

This example demonstrates how to set up data synchronization with Couchbase Lite in a peer-to-peer network scenario. The example allows for seamless data syncing across a variety of network interfaces, including Wi-Fi networks, device-to-device Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

This enables real-time collaboration and data sharing between nearby devices without the need for an intermediary server or access point, making it an ideal solution for applications that require efficient communication and synchronization in a peer-to-peer environment.

To run the app, download the latest [CouchbaseLiteSwift.xcframework](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads/?family=couchbase-lite) and copy it to the project's Frameworks directory.
